It’s why we developed The Momentous Three™—Protein, Creatine, and Omega-3—the nutrients our expert ecosystem identified as daily non-negotiables and the biggest impact drivers for performance, longevity, and overall health. The Momentous Three - Vegan comprises three daily essentials that are difficult to get from plant-based diets alone.Complete support on a cellular levelWhen taken daily, these 3 nutrients support muscle performance, daily energy, and cognitive function, setting you up for peak performance. 100% Plant Protein: Supports muscle growth, strength, and recovery, as well as immune function and tissue health.Creatine: Widely clinically-studied for improving muscle strength, power output, cognitive performance, and cellular energy production—not just for athletes, but for everyday high performers. Vegan Omega-3: Delivers essential fatty acids to support optimal brain and cardiovascular health as well as muscle and joint recovery.Held to The Momentous Standard™Everything you need, nothing you don’t. We formulate to the highest standards possible, meaning no sucralose, gums, fillers, stabilizers, or artificial ingredients of any kind—ever. We work with the sharpest minds in human performance to develop our products, and ensure every batch is NSF Certified for Sport® to meet the standards demanded by professional sports teams and Olympic committees.\n                    \n                \n                \n            \n            \n         \n\n                \n                \n                    Function\n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        100% Plant Protein:Fundamental Macronutrient: A building block of muscle, enzymes, hormones, and neurotransmittersTissue Repair: Supports repair and growth of muscles, organs, and skinMetabolic Function: Key for enzyme activity, hormone balance, cell signaling, and immune defenseEnergy & Wellness: Contributes to daily energy and supports overall health and well-beingCreatine:Power Output & Endurance: Creatine plays a vital role in cellular energy production by increasing the body’s phosphate reservoirs and supporting production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate)—your body’s primary energy currency.

During high-intensity activities, ATP is rapidly depleted; creatine helps regenerate it more efficiently, enabling you to push harder, recover faster, and perform better across repeated bouts of exertion.In the brain, creatine supports neuronal energy metabolism, contributing to improved memory, focus, processing speed, and overall cognitive resilience.

Ours is superior in that it’s cold-processed and micro-filtered, preserving the integrity of its amino acid profile while minimizing sugar, fat, and lactose.What sets our formula apart is the inclusion of ProHydrolase®, a clinically researched enzyme that enhances protein breakdown and amino acid uptake. This not only improves digestion and reduces the risk of GI discomfort, but also ensures that your body efficiently absorbs and utilizes the protein for maximum results.Whey isolate is known for its fast absorption—ideal for the post-workout window, when your muscles are most receptive to nutrients. It contains high levels of leucine, a key amino acid that directly stimulates muscle protein synthesis, making it a powerful tool for strength development and recovery.\n                    \n                \n                \n            \n            \n         \n\n                \n                \n                    How To Use\n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        1 scoop with 10-12 fluid ounces of preferred liquid, as needed, to reach optimal daily protein intake.The latest research suggests consuming 0.8 to 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily, depending on your fitness goals and activity level.Part of The Momentous Three, along with Creatine and Omega-3, as a daily essential for foundational health.\n                    \n                \n                \n            \n            \n         \n\n                \n                \n                    Ingredients\n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        Chocolate: grass-fed whey protein isolate, ProHydrolase®, natural flavors, cocoa, salt, monk fruit extract, steviaVanilla: grass-fed whey protein isolate, ProHydrolase®, natural flavors, salt, monk fruit extract, steviaUnflavored: grass-fed whey protein isolate, ProHydrolase®Strawberry: grass-fed whey protein isolate, ProHydrolase®, natural strawberry flavor, Reb M*, beet root/carrot juice powder (for color)ProHydrolase® is a clinically researched enzyme that enhances protein breakdown and amino acid uptake.*Reb M is a natural, plant-based sweetener with zero glycemic response or aftertaste. 250× sweeter than sugar without bloating, 2.5× sweeter than monk fruit, and made sustainably with less land, water, and crop rotation.\n                    \n                \n                \n            \n            \n         \n\n                \n                \n                    Onset Time & Expected Results\n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        Use daily, as needed to hit your individual protein goals. A general guideline many experts suggest is 0.8 to 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight (about 1.6 to 2.7 grams per kilogram) each day. Competitive athletes, people with intense training schedules, or those aiming to build significant muscle may benefit from the higher end of that rangeEstimated 4-6 weeks of supplementation for noticeable improvements in strength and performance, with consistent intake and resistance training. Long-term benefits are best achieved with consistent daily use.Results vary depending on a host of individual factors including diet and lifestyle, but may include increased strength and stamina, reduced recovery time, and improved overall wellbeing\n                    \n                \n                \n            \n            \n         \n\n                \n                \n                    Clinical Research & 3rd Party Test Results\n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n\n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        \n    \n  \n\n\n\n                    \n                    \n                        There are 4 credible reviews and studies related to this product:The Effect of ProHydrolase® on the Amino Acid and Intramuscular Anabolic Signaling Response to Resistance Exercise in Trained MalesEffects of whey protein supplementation prior to, and following, resistance exercise on body composition and training responses: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studyWhey protein isolate attenuates strength decline after eccentrically-induced muscle damage in healthy individualsEffect of timing of whey protein supplement on muscle damage markers after eccentric exercise",
