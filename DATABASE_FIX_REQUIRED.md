# Database Fix Required - Product Updates Not Working

## Problem Identified
The product edit/save functionality is failing because **ALL database updates** to the `products` table are blocked by a database trigger error:

```
ERROR: record "new" has no field "db_updated_at"
Code: 42703
```

## Root Cause
There is a database trigger on the `products` table that references a column called `db_updated_at`, but this column does not exist in the table schema.

The trigger is likely trying to do something like:
```sql
NEW.db_updated_at = NOW();
```

But the `db_updated_at` column is missing from the table.

## Evidence
- ✅ API authentication works correctly
- ✅ API receives and processes all form data correctly  
- ✅ API constructs valid Supabase update queries
- ❌ **ALL** database updates fail with the same error, regardless of which field is being updated
- ❌ Even single-field updates (like `eu_allowed = 'yes'`) fail with the same trigger error

## Database Schema Analysis
The `products` table has these columns:
- `updated_at` (exists) ✅
- `db_updated_at` (missing) ❌ <- **This is the problem**

## Required Fix
The database administrator needs to either:

### Option 1: Add the Missing Column (Recommended)
```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN db_updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW();
```

### Option 2: Fix/Remove the Problematic Trigger
Find and modify the trigger that references `db_updated_at` to either:
- Reference the correct column name (`updated_at`)
- Remove the problematic reference
- Drop the trigger entirely if not needed

## Impact
- **Current Status**: Zero product updates work - all fail silently
- **User Experience**: Shows "Success" but no data is actually saved
- **API Status**: Working correctly, blocked only by database constraints

## Verification
After the database fix, test with this simple update:
```javascript
supabase.from('products').update({ eu_allowed: 'yes' }).eq('handle', 'creatine-monohydrate')
```

This should succeed without the trigger error.

## Next Steps
1. Contact database administrator to apply the fix
2. Once fixed, all product editing functionality will work immediately
3. No application code changes are required after the database fix
